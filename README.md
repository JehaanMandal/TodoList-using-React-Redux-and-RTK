**Create a Redux Slice:
Use createSlice() to define your reducers, actions, and initial state in one place.
This simplifies action/reducer creation.

**Configure the Redux Store:
Use configureStore() to set up your Redux store.
This handles middleware and Redux DevTools setup.

**Provide the Store to React:
Wrap your root React component with <Provider store={store}> from react-redux.
This makes the store available to all components.

**Access State and Dispatch Actions:
Use useSelector() to read data from the Redux store in your components.
Use useDispatch() to dispatch actions to update the store's state.
